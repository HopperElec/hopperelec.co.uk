My [current website (www-v2)](https://www.hopperelec.co.uk/) is written using raw HTML, CSS, JS and PHP without any kind of modularity.
This has resulted in a bit of a mess and makes it hard to maintain. Hence, I've not made it open-source!

This version (www-v3) will be a re-creation of my current site but using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
which introduces a lot of features to make the code more readable and maintainable, without cutting on performance.

The improved readability of this new version makes me happy enough to make it open-source, hence you finding it here!
