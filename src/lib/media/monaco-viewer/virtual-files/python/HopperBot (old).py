HopperBot is the Discord bot I use for most Discord servers I create or moderate.

It was originally developed using Discord.py and included the following features before I switched to JDA:
- Moderation logging
- Purging
- Polls
- Automatically generating numbered VCs
- A playlist
- An economy
- AI analysis and impersonations of some users (friends, only with consent)
