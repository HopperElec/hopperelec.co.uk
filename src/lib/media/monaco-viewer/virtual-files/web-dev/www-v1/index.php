  <p>I made my first websites in early 2016 using Wix. However, that isn't what I consider to be the start of my web development journey.</p>
  <p>That title goes to hopp.ga, which is a website I made in early 2019 using XAMPP and PHP.</p>
  <p style="color:red;">NOTE: I don't own that domain anymore, so it is not my responsibility if you visit it!</p>
